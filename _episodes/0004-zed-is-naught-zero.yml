author: Ian C. Anderson and Matthew Sumner

# For best results, choose a subtitle that is only a few words long.
subtitle: And the pessimistic magnifying glasses

# This is the verbose show description, up to 4,000 char long
summary: Ian and Matt cover perception vs reality, playing This War of Mine with
  a single character, listener feedback, the color orange, past tenses,
  pronouncing the Ts in buttermilk, Horace and Pete, the etymology of Television
  Show, the evolutionary need to watch horror movies, synesthesia, and bipolar
  disorder. They try the Vanilla Bourbon Oak Stout again after it has been
  subjected to a warmer environment, hoping for better carbonation. Ian airs his
  greivances about lit open signs on businesses that are obviously closed, and
  they consider how constraints can help creativity. All three music clips in
  this episode were (very quickly) created and exported using Apple's new Music
  Memos app, with no other editing or processing. This episode was generously
